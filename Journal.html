<p1>Today is the first day I am starting on this journal, so far I have just done the menu screen as well as added the links to journal, projects, and about me. I have learned a lot so far. In the next week I want to finish the menu screen and maybe start on my first project.

<p1>Today is my second journal entry. It is a sunday. I have almost finished my home page I am not sure what else I should add, but we will see. I have started working on my first project using java and it is working. I want to finish my project by next week and start working on a new one.
