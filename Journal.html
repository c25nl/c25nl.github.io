<p>Today is the first day I am starting on this journal, so far I have just done the menu screen as well as added the links to journal, projects, and about me. I have learned a lot so far. In the next week I want to finish the menu screen and maybe start on my first project.

<p>Today is my second journal entry. It is a sunday. I have almost finished my home page I am not sure what else I should add, but we will see. I have started working on my first project using java and it is working. I want to finish my project by next week and start working on a new one.

<p>Today I finished working on my design for the journal. I also did the design for the projects page and kept working on my present. I got rid of the spinning cow because it is very weird and hard to click on the links because of how it spins.

<p>Today I am working on the checklist for what I need to do by winter break. One of those things is writing 5 journal entries. After this I will have done 4. I am also going to push two of my code sketches.

<p>Today I am still completing my checklist. I will finish my fruit code sketch and make sure I understand the java script.

<p>Today I pushed a bunch of my websites. I am starting to feel more comfortable with java script. For my valentines project I used inner text so when it is clicked text shows up. I also made a sushi drawing codesketch with java script as well.
